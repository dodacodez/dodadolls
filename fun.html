          <strong>FUN IDEAS & INSPIRATION</strong>
          <p>
          On this page I want to let you in on some fun Barbie things I discovered online.
          May it be remodelling or OOAK ideas, funny pictures, dioramas, DIYs, or my favourite
          doll bloggers.

            <strong>MASKS - </strong>Sadly 2020 happens to be a tough year. I hope you all take care of yourselves and wear a mask!
            </p>
            Barbie has also taken up the habit and many gorgeous dolls can be seen wearing masks on instagram.

            <strong>MUMMY DIY - </strong>I found this crazy Barbie mummy on ebay. A seller called "Steinebock" was offering her as a vintage OOAK. The idea seems very cool!
            </p>
            <p>
            You can probably try this out with various materials: fabric tape, cast / plaster strips, etc. It seems also a great idea for salvaging some broken or old dolls which look horrible and look better covered up.

          <strong>CRAFTS BY FROGGY - </strong>Almost everybody in the doll community knows the amazing MyFroggyStuff and her sheer endless flow of DIY ideas for dolls. I picked one of her videos as an example on how to produce some cute quarantaine doll items at home. Enjoy!

              <strong>TENNIS FAN - </strong>
              I grew up in a family of tennis fanatics. Therefore I have recently discovered the joy of getting tennis outfits for my dolls. I have some, but by far not all, so there is quite a list of items I still have to get. This year's release of the iconic Billie Jean King as part of the Inspiring Women series marked a very special moment in my collector heart. Finally a quality doll with realistic outfit and racket that is far from those rather cheaply executed playline tennis dolls of the past years!
              <br>
              A funny vintage ad I stumbled upon is this quite scary looking Dusty (not Barbie) doll. She seemed to have been quite the player and apparently came with a dark skinned colleague. Enjoy some blast from the past! (and let me know if you have any cool tennis outfits for sale)
