      Hello dear Barbie fan and visitor, here are some facts about me.
      <div style="text-align: right; float: right; margin-left: 0.6em">
      <img src="images/meDollcap01.jpg" height="270" width="220" alt="doll cap">
      </div>

      Barbie dolls have always fascinated me. My first memories of them came from advertising magazines of the Superstar era which showed off Barbie, Skipper and Ken in their amazing flamboyant 80ies fashions.

    I remember standing in front of a huge shelf at a big convenience store. The Steffie faced Jewel Secrets Princess Laura (the European version of Jewel Secrets Whitney) had just arrived. She was presented right next to the Perfume Pretty Whitney.

    <div style="text-align: center; float: left; margin-right: 1em">
    <img style="display: block" src="./images/whitneyPerfume.jpg" height="170" width="230" alt="Perfume Pretty Whitney">
    <a href="https://flic.kr/p/Ex5RVC"><small>Perfume Pretty Whitney <br>by Marseline Queen</small></a></div>

    <p>Both of them were my biggest wish, but my parents did not have enough money to buy them. I kept staring at the beauty of the Steffie face and those gorgeous blue fashions and dreamt about one day growing up and being able to afford such beauties. But would I then be still able to play with and enjoy them?

    <div style="text-align: left; float: right; margin-left: 1em">
    </div>
    Fast forward over 20 years later: over the course of decades,
    step by step, I was able to "amass" quite a small collection of Steffie faced dolls. I also enjoy the new fashionista lines
    (especially AA dolls, their skin tones are amazing) and some superstar era Barbies.
    Still, the only one missing is the Jewel Secrets Princess Laura<center>-irony?</center>

    I enjoy watching (even seemingly unprofessional) doll videos online. Whenever I find the time I video blog in an amateur and super improvised manner about my own thrift hauls, marketplace or ebay doll purchases and newly acquired gems on my YouTube channel.

        Currently I am building up my dollstore on instagram (even though I have been selling on ebay for years, find me under my name there).
        I liquidate parts of my old collection or offer up dolls from friends or trusted dealers who changed their tastes or want to switch up their collections as well.
        <br>
        I ship worldwide, although the sad and dramatic global pandemic has made it hard for me to effectively reach some countries by post without risking a huge delay.
        <p>
        I love getting positive feedback and seeing the happiness dolls can bring. Most of my customers send me pictures of their buys from the <a href="https://instagram.com/dodadollstore">DodaDollStore</a>, but this one especially stood out in 2020, so I want to share it with you &#10084;</p>
