**October 2021** - Slowly they are becoming available: the pink tubes that promise color reveal party/confetti fun and dolls with soft heads, real hair and translucent glittery legs!

In this blog I shall reveal the **100% confirmed** European codes that are known to me for all five party girls from the confetti series.

[note: the following codes have been spotted in 🇩🇪 Germany 🇦🇹 Austria 🇨🇿 Czech Republic]

## The dolls in their correct order ❤︎

To identify the code, we first have to line up the party dolls in their correct order (according to the portraits on the lower part of the packaging!):

For more in depth information on how to read the codes and figure out the numbering if you spot a middle number that differs from the ones I included here, I highly urge you to watch my _mermaid video_ (see below).
Numbers of dolls I have not personally unpacked are in brackets.

- **1. Teresa -** This series starts off with a classic Teresa faced Barbie. She has red hair (with a blue streak), red translucent legs and a teal top.

  Numbers: **(1091HF) 1721HF, 1861HF**

- **2. Daya (hispanic with violet hair streak and pink legs)**

  Numbers: **(1241HF) 1731HF, 1871HF**

- **3. Millie**

  Numbers: **(1131HF, 1251HF) 1741HF, 1881HF**

- **4. Pale beauty -** Pale, vampirish doll reminiscent of one of the cheap playline beach dolls from a few years back. She is a bold mix of teal and purple colors.

  Numbers: **(1261HF) 1751HF, 1891HF**

- **5. Daya (dark with pink hair streak) -** This doll was the main reason I even took interest in this series. As you can see below I immediately rebodied her unto a MTM yellow top body. Her hair is very ample and I am considering shortening it, since this Daya would certainly wear a short bob and still look classy!

  Numbers: **(1271HF) 1761HF, 1901HF**

  After dipping her into warm water her hair streak changes from pink to white. Somehow neither cold nor heat managed to revert her lip color back (which should darken again).
