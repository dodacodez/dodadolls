**January 2021** - You may have seen them in store or online: the blue tubes that promise color reveal fun and mermaids with real hair (no wigs this time!).

In this blog I shall reveal the **100% confirmed** European codes that are known to me for all 5 mermaids, some Chelseas and singled out pets from this series.

For more interactive fun, check out my elaborate YouTube video on the topic here:

[note: the following codes have been spotted in 🇩🇪 Germany 🇦🇹 Austria 🇭🇺 Hungary 🇮🇹 Italy and the 🇨🇿 Czech Republic]

## The dolls in their correct order ❤︎

To identify the code, we first have to line up the mermaid dolls in their correct order:

For more in depth information on how to read the codes and figure out the numbering if you spot a middle number that differs from the ones I included here (being the rows of 30s, 40s, 50s and 60s), I highly urge you to watch my _video_. Numbers of dolls I have not personally unpacked are in brackets.

- **1. Millie -** This series starts off with the one and only Millie faced Barbie. I did not get her since she is too plain for my taste and I do not enjoy her make-up that much (even though she gives me Lady Gaga vibes from her "Stupid love" video).

  Numbers: **(236OI, 257OI)**

- **2. Daisy -** I call her that because she has the "Life in a dreamhouse" face sculpt of the pink haired Daisy. She is a gorgeous dark doll!

  Numbers: **237OI (258OI)**

- **3. Teresa -** We've seen this girl before, she was very prominent in the second and third wave of the Fashionistas. Here she is bringing avantgarde goth make-up into your home!

  Numbers: **(238OI) 259OI**

  <img src="/images/CR_M_Teresa_kl.jpg" alt="Daisy" width="190" height="255">

- **4. Daya -** The mellow, slightly shy rainbow princess is my favorite of this series.

  Numbers: **239OI (260OI)**

  <img src="/images/CR_M_Daya_kl.jpg" alt="Daisy" width="190" height="255">

- **5. Dimples -** Like a winter goddess, Dimples shines in this variation with iridescent white hair and a warm smile.

  Numbers: **(240OI) 261OI**

## Mermaid Pets

Since the mermaids already burnt a hole into my wallet, I stuck to buying two Chelseas and two pets, which still can give a pretty good hint at the number codes of the rest.

To start off with the pets: the easy way out would be to glimpse to the bottom of the packaging. Usually you can get a feel for the color of the outer shell which pretty much gives away the animal hidden inside. This series comes with 1 magical cat, 2 cutest dogs (frenchies?) and 2 seals.

After the color reveal their mermaid tails glitter heavily, so this is definitely a highlight! The shells are quite decorative (as you can see from the main picture on top of this page), so I definitely recommend snatching them if you can.

## Color Reveal Mermaid Chelseas

The cute Chelseas reveal new colors after a warm bath. Their tails are glittery and partially transparent, which makes for fun play once the water gets trapped inside them. ❤︎ Please be advised that there is only a 100% guarantee of accuracy on the two opened dolls which are underlined. The numbers with a question mark are highly likely, though not confirmed by a purchase.

- **Version 1:** Assuming that the order of the little ones also follows the pictures on the package, I made my own assumptions as to the rest of the codes for the girls. There is a weird break in numbers though if you follow this scheme, which ended up directing me more towards the second version of possible code distribution. The last row is just a guess of mine, but it could be that the order is totally different altogether.

- **Version 2 (more likely):** Going by the order of their big sisters, I lined up the Chelseas accordingly in the picture. This version makes more sense since it seems more coherent, though it forces the row to start with a "29", a "late" number, which all in itself is a bit weird and unexpected.

**Have fun exploring!**
