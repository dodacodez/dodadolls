**February 2021** - As you may know, I have been collecting on and off for over 20 years, with the online market being one of the biggest sources of my middle sized Barbie collection.
So it is not a coincidence that I discovered Rann's channel online as soon as I wanted to know more about certain Barbie dolls.

**I am very happy to have gotten the chance to sit down and talk to Rann**, the creator and host of "Barbie Dolls of the Week", a YouTube channel dedicated to the contemporary adult collector. It is a great source of information and one of the few qualitative channels that inspired me to dig deeper into everything Barbie and that accompanied me while I was restarting my collection in 2017.

### The topics we get into are (among others):
* Steffie dolls (my favorite face mold)
* Importing dolls from the US
* DIY ideas for dolls
* What started my collection

Feel free to participate in the discussion on YouTube! If anyone is versed in the problems of 70s hair fiber in Barbie (which I shortly mentioned in this interview) and knows how come some hair gets this slick and oily after some time, please let me know!
