May 2021 - You may have come across them in your childhood or some decades ago: Petra Plasty dolls or even some Bettys.

In this blog I want to talk about the (in some places still popular) copycats of Barbie.

## Honorable mentions

As some of you may know, Hasbro also brought out quite intriguing "Cindy" playline dolls with their intense face. I guess I would even prefer them to Petra, it just happened that Petra was more available in my hometown and was always making sure to knock off Barbie's themes. So it was the go-to option if a child dreamt of the real thing (=Barbie, Mattel), but parents could not afford it.
Cindy went her own way, had her own style and looking back I keep appreciating this line of dolls more and more. It is a pity that they did not produce more dark skinned girls though, those look amazing but are notoriously hard to find today.

The annoyance that is still out there and presumably selling well is "Steffi Love".
I have quite a love-hate relationship with her. I cannot stand the cheap quality of some of her clothes and the ghostly facepaint that looks like a mask. I do however appreciate the price point and some collaborations (with Sanrio, Swarovsky) came out quite good. Indeed I happened to buy some of those dolls for the outfits alone and the packaging is usually nicely done, too. It is just a pity that the doll itself has a weird shape, the face is dead and the overall look of her body poor/cheap.

Another doll line I came across whilst scouring American ebay was XXXXX

And then we should not forget about Integrity Toys (IT) that brought out various dark skinned beauties which many of us collectors don't want to miss. Since they came out in the 90s and show a more serious face, I would not completely consider them playline dolls and therefore only mention them on a side note.
