**June 2021** - As you may know, I have been collecting on and off for over 20 years, with the online market being one of the biggest sources of my middle sized Barbie collection.
So it is not a coincidence that I discovered Rann's channel online as soon as I wanted to know more about certain Barbie dolls.

**I am very happy to have gotten the chance to sit down a SECOND TIME and talk to Rann** about some new additions to my collection, 90s furniture and the new LOOK series. Rann's YouTube channel is dedicated to the contemporary adult collector and one of the best sources for a comfy afternoon with a good cup of tea watching dolls online.

### The topics we get into are (among others):
* 80s dolls and fashions
* DIY and 90s furniture
* The inspiring women series
* and of course the new LOOK dolls (I dedicated a whole blog entry to them <a href="/blog/barbie-fashion-icon.html" target="_blank">HERE</a>!)
