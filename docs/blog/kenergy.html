        <h2>Was ist DodaDolls?</h2>
        <p>
          Mein Name ist Doda und ich bin eine passionierte Barbie-Sammlerin
          (bevorzugt Steffie-Face). Auf DodaDolls findet ihr Fotos aus meiner
          Sammlung, Puppenunikate, seltene Barbies und Accessoires, Diorama-
          sowie Fashion-Inspirationen. In meinem DollFinder (Puppen-Suche)
          mÃ¶chte ich Euch helfen, Eure Wunschpuppe zu finden und nach Hause zu
          holen. Als Kind hatte ich einige wenige Barbies, da sich meine Eltern
          nicht wirklich welche leisten konnten. Meine Lieblinge waren Geschenke
          von Bekannten meiner Eltern aus den 70ern, die bereits von deren
          Kindern bespielt worden waren. Ich verliebte mich als 8-JÃ¤hrige in
          eine Jewel Secrets Whitney / Prinzessin Laura und schwor mir insgeheim
          diese Puppe zu kaufen sobald ich erwachsen bin. Mehr als 20 Jahre
          spÃ¤ter bestaune ich meine kleine aber feine Steffie-Face Sammlung an
          verpackten und unverpackten Barbies. Auch einige Fashionistas haben es
          mir angetan. Mit viel Freude fotografiere ich meine MÃ¤dels und baue
          RÃ¤umlichkeiten fÃ¼r ihre Puppenevents. Auf Youtube findet ihr meine
          Deboxing Videos der mir liebsten Puppen, Kleider, MÃ¶belsets und
          Accessoires. Ich lade Euch ein auf eine farbenfrohe Reise in die
          virtuelle Welt der DodaDolls!

        <h2>Who's DodaDolls?</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Doda and I am a passionate and avid Barbie collector
          (preferably Steffie mold). You can find pictures of my collection, one
          of a kind doll creations, rare Barbies and accessories, as well as
          diorama inspirations on my page. My DollFinder shall assist your
          search for your perfect doll. I want to help you bring your dream doll
          home! When I was young I only had a few Barbies since my parents could
          not afford them. Some of my favourites included vintage dolls from the
          70ies that my parents' friends had given us as a gift (and which had
          been played with by their own children). When I was around 8 years old
          I fell in love with Jewel Secrets Whitney and made a silent promise to
          myself: "When I grow up, I shall get all the Barbies I always dreamed
          of." Over 20 years later I can look at a small but solid collection of
          boxed and unboxed Steffie mold dolls, Barbies and Fashionistas. It
          gives me enormous joy to photograph and pose my hybrid dolls or create
          rooms for their doll events. You can find my deboxing videos on
          Youtube, which mostly show my favourite Barbie dolls, fashions,
          playsets and accessoires. Let me invite you on a colourful trip into
          the amazing world of DodaDolls!

    <p>  <strong>July 2023</strong> - It&#39;s been a while since I posted the last time, since I had to cut back on some of my private Barbie time recently. Check out my reels on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dodadolls">instagram</a> and some short insights on <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dodadollstok">TikTok</a> though! </p>
<p>  <strong>Everybody is having great expectations for the upcoming epic BARBIE MOVIE</strong> (and rightfully so). </p>
<p>  <img src="/images/ryan_blue.jpg">Picture: Warner Bros.</p>
<p>  There is one character almost stealing Barbie&#39;s show: KEN. I must admit, when I first heard that Ryan Gosling would be playing Ken, I was less than amused. Being a Gosling AND Barbie fan, I somehow could not fit those two together and thought it was a mismatch. He seems too old for the role, plus his facial features did not seem fitting in my eyes. But boy, Ryan&#39;s acting talent makes all up for it!</p>
  <img src="/images/kentooold.jpg" style="max-width: 40%; display: block; margin: auto;">

<h3 id="ryan-goslings-ken-is-a-revolutionary-role">Ryan Gosling&#39;s Ken is a Revolutionary Role</h3>
<p>  When the first images of Ryan Gosling as Ken in the upcoming Barbie movie were released, not only me, but also the internet was divided. Some people were excited to see the actor take on such a iconic role, while others were less than impressed. However, there&#39;s no denying that Gosling&#39;s take on Ken is revolutionary.</p>
<p>  For decades, Ken has been portrayed as the perfect but dull male doll. An accessory to Barbie, an empty shell of a man. He&#39;s always been handsome and athletic, but his clothing choices were few. Gosling&#39;s Ken promises to be different. He&#39;s not afraid to show his flaws, he is self-reflecting and even a little bit goofy.</p>
  <center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pU9uYpkP4zI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></center>

<p>  This is a refreshing change of pace for the character of Ken. It&#39;s also a sign of the times. In recent years, there&#39;s been a growing movement to challenge traditional gender stereotypes. And Gosling&#39;s Ken is a perfect example of this. He&#39;s not afraid to be himself, even if that means  being different from the traditional Ken.</p>
<p>  On another note: the definitive strength of this movie lies in the fact that Greta Gerwig managed to focus on one important aspect for her story: the way children play with dolls. She skilfully lets this fantasy/real world combination shine through in many pivotal scenes:</p>
  <center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gvZccmVDl9Y" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></center>

<h3 id="goslings-ken-is-a-sign-of-progress">Gosling&#39;s Ken is a sign of progress</h3>
<p>  This Ken is more than just a refreshing change of pace for the character, Gosling even has coined his own term: &quot;Kenergy&quot;. He is devoted to Barbie and yet does not want to go under in the wave of all the other &quot;Kens&quot;. The borders get blurred: Ryan is so into being Ken that sometimes it is hard to tell where Ryan ends and his Ken role begins. &quot;Kenergy&quot; is a term that has been used to describe the energy or vibe that Ken is giving off in all the promo images for the movie. It&#39;s a combination of confidence, sass, and a little bit of camp. Some people have compared Ken&#39;s kenergy to that of a &#39;90s boy band member, while others have said that he looks like he&#39;s about to drop a fire album.</p>
  <img src="/images/ryan_houses.jpg" style="max-width: 55%; display: block; margin: auto;">

<p>  The Ken memes that have flooded the internet since the images were released are a testament to the power of kenergy. People have been using the memes to express their own feelings about Ken, as well as to make jokes about the character. Some of the most popular memes include Ken posing with a variety of objects, such as a banana, a surfboard, and a Barbie Dreamhouse. Others show Ken in different scenarios, such as attending a pool party or going on a date.</p>

<h3 id="goslings-natural-comedic-timing---kencurious-kenfused-kenergy">Gosling&#39;s natural comedic timing - Kencurious, Kenfused, Kenergy</h3>
<p>  Gosling knows how to deliver a line in a way that is both funny, believable and relatable. This is evident in many of his previous roles, such as in &quot;Crazy, Stupid, Love&quot;, as well as various interviews (such as on the Graham Norton show, where he delivered comedy gold whilst pairing with Harrison Ford). </p>
  <center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aNJ_JPkbH2M" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></center>

<p>  Second, Gosling is not afraid to make himself look ridiculous. He is willing to embrace the campiness of the role and to play it up for laughs. This is evident in the first images of Gosling as Ken, where he is seen wearing crazy outfits and posing in a variety of ridiculous ways. </p>
<p>  Third, Gosling is surrounded by a talented cast that is also willing to play up the humour of the role. This includes grand comedians like Will Ferrell (playing the CEO of Mattel) and Kate McKinnon (playing the Barbie oracle). In one image, Ken is seen wearing a pink tank top and white briefs. He is posing in a way that is meant to be sexy, but Gosling&#39;s expression makes it clear that he is not taking himself too seriously. </p>
<h3 id="hes-just-ken">He&#39;s &quot;just Ken&quot;</h3>
<p>  In a recent music video released by Warner Bros., Ken is singing and dancing to the song called &quot;I&#39;m just Ken.&quot; The composition is actually really good, catchy and funny, and Gosling&#39;s performance is hilarious.
  The song &quot;I&#39;m Just Ken&quot; is a satirical take on the traditional Ken character. It is sung from Ken&#39;s perspective, and it expresses his feelings of insecurity and inadequacy. Ken sings about how he always feels like he is second best to Barbie, and how he is constantly trying to live up to her expectations. The song is both funny and poignant, and it provides a glimpse into the inner workings of Ken&#39;s mind. </p>
<h3 id="im-just-ken-and-im-enough-and-im-great-at-doing-stuff">&quot;I&#39;m just Ken and I&#39;m enough and I&#39;m great at doing stuff&quot;</h3>
  <center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OGR9vTOgRJ4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></center>

<h3 id="the-barbie-movie-is-sure-to-be-a-hit">The Barbie movie is sure to be a hit</h3>
<p>  From what I can tell from the 3 trailers and additional snippets we have been offered in the past weeks, the Barbie movie is very well thought out and sure to be a hit. It&#39;s got a star-studded cast, a talented director, and a fresh take on a classic and sometimes boring character. With Gosling&#39;s Ken leading the way (next to Barbie, of course!), it&#39;s sure to be a movie that everyone can enjoy. If you&#39;re looking for a movie that will make you laugh, cry, and think, then be sure to check out the Barbie movie when it hits theaters in July 2023. I think we both won&#39;t be disappointed and I have the feeling that even some Barbie haters will turn fans after this unique experience.</p>
